Project Topic: Mobile Currency Exchange System
1. Project Objective
The goal of the project is to design and implement a mobile system that enables users to perform basic currency exchange operations. The project aims to practically apply concepts related to communication between a mobile application, a web service (SOAP/REST), and a database, as well as integration with an external API (National Bank of Poland).
2. Project Scope
A. Mobile Application
• User registration and login
• Account funding (simulated virtual transfer)
• Viewing current currency exchange rates (retrieved from the NBP API)
• Access to historical exchange rates
• Execution of buy/sell currency transactions
• Viewing transaction history and current balance
B. Web Service (SOAP or REST)
• Implementation of business logic for the exchange office
• Integration with NBP API to obtain exchange rates
• Handling communication with the mobile application
• Data validation and user authorization
C. Database
• Storing user information• Recording transactions
• Saving users’ currency wallet balances
3. Project Stages
Part 1 – Conceptual Design (Analysis and Design Phase)
• Development of functional and non-functional requirements
• Preparation of a use case diagram (UML)
• Preparation of a class diagram (for both the mobile app and web service)
• Designing the database model (ERD diagram)Deliverables: PDF report + diagram files
Part 2 – Implementation (Programming Phase)
• Implementation of the mobile app in any language/framework (e.g., Kotlin, Flutter, React Native)
• Implementation of the Web Service (e.g., Java Spring Boot, Node.js, .NET Core)
• Implementation of the database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
• Integration of all components
• Preparation of a short user manualFinal Evaluation: Project presentation + live demonstration
4. Grading Criteria

Criterion || Weight	|| Description

Final Grade:
5.0 – Complete project, meets all requirements, includes extra features
4.5 – Complete project, minor issues or missing extras
4.0 – Meets basic requirements, correct architecture
3.5 – Functional, but limited integration or logical issues
3.0 – Minimal functionality, missing parts of documentation
2.0 – Project not functional or not submitted


5. Technical Requirements
• The application should run on Android (or cross-platform)
• Communication with the server via HTTP/HTTPS
